In this project I had to analyze AtliQ a Telecom company’s business before and after the launch of 5G. And also compare its performance with those of its competitors.
The Dashboard is divided into 3 categories – Revenue, Market-Share and Plan Analysis.
Insights
From the visualizations we can see that revenue has taken a slight hit after the implementation of 5G.
PIO has the highest % of market share followed by Britel and AtliQ.
Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Bangalore and Chennai are the cities that have generated the highest revenue whereas Chandigarh, Gurgaon, and Raipur have generated the least revenue.
The Market-share dashboard shows the change of Revenue, ARPU and TAU of each city before 5G and after 5G implementation.
Plan P1, P2 and P3 were the best performers before 5g, where after 5Gs introduction plan P1, P2 and P11 are performing best.
Forecasting revenue of each plans based on previous trends.
